# Portfolio
A portfolio of my projects. 
While I prepare my projects for GitHub, this page will only contain PDFs for my independent research projects done as an undergrad in economics at UC Berkeley.

## Independent Research Projects:
[Pricing Disparities for Minority Communities in Chicago: Rideshares and Taxis](https://drive.google.com/open?id=14ZV97LYL9PZYJ8o2ozB82O9pNnNnjNDr) - *Economics Honors Thesis.* **Abstract:**
> Using a random sample of 5.6 million taxi and ridesharing rides taken over an 11-month period spanning 2018-2019 in 77 Chicago Community Areas, I estimate the difference in group mean fare for rides in minority and nonminority communities taken through a Taxi company or a Transportation Network Provider (TNP). I find that for rides in minority communities, TNPs offer lower fares than taxis but fares are still higher than those for similar TNP rides in non-minority communities. On average, TNP trips were 19.4% cheaper than taxis for trips between nonwhite communities but 12.2% more expensive than similar TNP trips between white communities. TNP rides in Black communities were about 11% less expensive than taxis but those rides were about 4.6% more expensive than similar rides in non-Black communities.

[Planes, Permits and Automobiles](https://drive.google.com/open?id=12GV13m965rZt8Sd0lUMruzclVShku1ze) - **Abstract:**
> This paper examines the effect the number of Uber drivers has on the rate of Fatal Traffic Collisions in metropolitan areas in the United States. Utilizing an instrumental variables approach using airport permit requests and google trend data, this paper finds an ~%1-4 increase in fatal accidents per 100,00 residents per additional 100 Uber drivers with airport permits.
